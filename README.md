# Facial-expression-recognition
Machine Learning Lab project


Facial expression recognition has played a special role in recent research, but remains chal-
lenging for computer vision. This paper discusses Lenet-5 and ways to improve it in relation to
the problem of recognizing facial expressions. It turned out that Lenet-5 with dropout solves
this problem, and the accuracy of the model is higher than that of other modernized versions,
excluding to the ensemble of models with normalization methods. Moreover, decreasing the filter
size can improve model accuracy. However, it will be necessary to investigate this impact in the
future by implementing different filter sizes in a wide variety of areas. It should be noted that
the use of normalization methods does not always guarantee good results, and the impact of their
simultaneous implementation in one model needs to be investigated
